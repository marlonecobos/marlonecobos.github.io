&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;strong>nichevol&lt;/strong> is an R package that helps users to perform critical steps in the process of assessment of speciesâ€™ ecological niche evolution, with uncertainty incorporated explicitly in reconstructions. The method proposed here for ancestral reconstruction of ecological niches characterizes niches using a bin-based approach that incorporates uncertainty in estimations. Compared to other existing methods, the approaches presented here reduce risks of overestimation of amounts or rates of ecological niche evolution. The main analyses include: initial exploration of environmental data in occurrence records and accessible areas, preparation of data for phylogenetic analyses, comparative phylogenetic analyses, and plotting for interpretation. These tools are based on the methods proposed by &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Owens et al. (2020)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">Epidemiology is one of many fields that use ecological niche modeling to assess potential distributions or potential range expansions of species. When such models are transferred in space and time, it is important to understand sources and location of uncertainty in their predictions. Here, we used the tick species Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (distributed in different areas around the world) as an example; for the first time, we characterized its global geographic distribution using ecological niche modeling, and explore the uncertainty involved in transferring models in space and time. We assessed uncertainties based on risks of strict extrapolation and amounts and patterns of variation in our predictions. We integrated occurrence records and climate data to calibrate models for 5 world regions, and to project them to 11 general circulation models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios (RCPs) for 2050. Models created in different calibration areas showed high agreement of suitable areas among model predictions from the eastern United States, southern Mexico, South America, Europe, North Africa, sub-Saharan countries, Asia, and Australia. The global potential distributions of R. sanguineus sensulato were very similar between the two RCPs, but GCMs, model replicates, and model parametrizations contributed importantly to the overall variation detected. Patterns of uncertainty (strict extrapolation areas and variation) in our model predictions depended on the calibration area, and underlined the important implications of not considering variability and extrapolation risk in interpretations of ecological niche model projections.&lt;/p>
