My roots trace back to Zamora Chinchipe, a small province in the southernmost part of the Amazon region, but the majority of my life story unfolded in Loja, a picturesque city nestled in the Andes to the south.\nMy academic journey commenced at Universidad Nacional de Loja (Ecuador), followed by a detour to Universidad de La Habana (Cuba) for my master’s degree. The culmination of my educational pursuits was marked by obtaining my Ph.D. from the University of Kansas (USA). Currently, I am engaged in postdoctoral research at the University of Kansas, where I divide my time between the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Biodiversity Institute.\nFamily The cornerstone of my life undoubtedly rests upon my family’s unwavering love and support. Their presence has exerted an irreplaceable influence on every facet of my journey. My achievements owe much to their profound impact, and these words and milestones serve as a heartfelt expression of gratitude for the profound enrichment they have brought to my life.\nWhat do I like? Research Research occupies a central place in my life. While those close to me might jest that I am entirely consumed by my work, the truth is more nuanced. Indeed, my deep-seated passion for science might give the impression that I am wholly devoted to my job, but what truly fuels me is the exploration of the scientific realm. My passion lies in delving into the mysteries of science, unraveling fresh research problems, and pursuing their solutions.\nMy research interests span a diverse array of topics, all converging within the fascinating field of distributional ecology. My quest revolves around understanding the determinants of species’ geographic distributions. This curiosity leads me to engage in various research avenues. One of my primary interests involves crafting innovative methods and tools to construct models capable of characterizing ecological niches and predicting species distributions. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in assessing the broader context, such as predicting potential disease outbreaks and pandemics. The challenge of comprehending the factors that could precipitate an epidemic is akin to tackling an intricate puzzle, a pursuit that resonates deeply with my identity as a scientist.\nSports and friends In my earlier years, sports held a significant place in my life. I dedicated numerous years to basketball and even participated in various leagues in Ecuador. However, in recent times, my engagement with sports has shifted towards recreational enjoyment, especially when shared with friends. Although I still enjoy shooting hoops, my leisure time is primarily devoted to volleyball and ping pong.\nHobies Beyond my scientific endeavors, my leisure time is often occupied by my hobbies. Electronics and the art of tinkering hold a special appeal for me. There is an inexplicable satisfaction in assembling and fine-tuning intricate systems to perfection. Over the years, my interests in this domain have cultivated a fascination with tools, leading to the amassing of a comprehensive collection that some might consider excessive for my pursuits.

The choice of calibration areas for such models has strong effects on model outcomes and model interpretation, as well as on model transfer to distinct environmental settings. However, approaches to selecting these areas remain simple and/or unlinked to biological concepts. Such models should be calibrated within areas that the species of interest has explored throughout its recent history, the accessible area (M). In this paper, we provide a simulation approach for estimating a species’ M considering processes of dispersal, colonization, and extinction in constant current climate or glacial-interglacial climate change frameworks, implemented within a new R package we developed called grinnell. Using the avian genus Aphelocoma, we explored different parameterizations of our simulation, and compared them to current approaches for M selection, in terms of model performance and risk of extrapolation using the algorithm Maxent and mobility-oriented parity analyses. Model calibration exercises from all approaches resulted in at least one model meeting optimal performance criteria for each species; however, we noted high variability among taxa and M selection methods. More importantly, M hypotheses derived directly from simulations of key biological processes, rather than being based on simple proxies of those processes, and as such are better suited to erecting biologically appropriate contrasts in model calibration, and to characterizing the potential for model extrapolation more rigorously. Major factors in our simulations were environmental layer resolution, dispersal kernel characteristics, and the inclusion of a changing framework of climatic conditions. This contribution represents the first simulation-based method for selecting calibration areas for ENM and SDM, offering a quantitative approach to estimate the accessible area of a species while considering its dispersal ability, along with patterns of change in environmental suitability across space and time.\n","date":1625356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625356800,"objectID":"70a89e5fddf574070076b882f1568d2c","permalink":"https://marlonecobos..github.io/publication/10.21425-f5fbg48814/","publishdate":"2021-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10.21425-f5fbg48814/","section":"publication","summary":"A description of methods to simulate areas accessible to species, also presented as an R package.","tags":["R programming","Open source","Simulations","ENM"],"title":"A simulation-based method for identifying accessible areas as calibration areas for ecological niche models and species distribution models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdelghafar Alkishe","Marlon E.

When such models are transferred in space and time, it is important to understand sources and location of uncertainty in their predictions. Here, we used the tick species Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (distributed in different areas around the world) as an example; for the first time, we characterized its global geographic distribution using ecological niche modeling, and explore the uncertainty involved in transferring models in space and time. We assessed uncertainties based on risks of strict extrapolation and amounts and patterns of variation in our predictions. We integrated occurrence records and climate data to calibrate models for 5 world regions, and to project them to 11 general circulation models (GCMs) and two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios (RCPs) for 2050. Models created in different calibration areas showed high agreement of suitable areas among model predictions from the eastern United States, southern Mexico, South America, Europe, North Africa, sub-Saharan countries, Asia, and Australia. The global potential distributions of R. sanguineus sensulato were very similar between the two RCPs, but GCMs, model replicates, and model parametrizations contributed importantly to the overall variation detected. Patterns of uncertainty (strict extrapolation areas and variation) in our model predictions depended on the calibration area, and underlined the important implications of not considering variability and extrapolation risk in interpretations of ecological niche model projections.\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"42df92949b19c1d2f4d433ddb74bd5c5","permalink":"https://marlonecobos..github.io/publication/10.1016-j.pecon.2020.03.002/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10.1016-j.pecon.2020.03.002/","section":"publication","summary":"A detailed demonstration of how to represent variability and uncertainty in ENM predictions.","tags":["Disease vector","Uncertainty","ENM"],"title":"Recognizing sources of uncertainty in disease vector ecological niche models: An example with the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlon E.

The calibration phase of these models is critical, but despite recent attempts at providing tools for performing this step, adequate detail is still missing. Here, we present the kuenm R package, a new set of tools for performing detailed development of ecological niche models using the platform Maxent in a reproducible way. Results This package takes advantage of the versatility of R and Maxent to enable detailed model calibration and selection, final model creation and evaluation, and extrapolation risk analysis. Best parameters for modeling are selected considering (1) statistical significance, (2) predictive power, and (3) model complexity. For final models, we enable multiple parameter sets and model transfers, making processing simpler. Users can also evaluate extrapolation risk in model transfers via mobility-oriented parity (MOP) metric. Discussion Use of this package allows robust processes of model calibration, facilitating creation of final models based on model significance, performance, and simplicity. Model transfers to multiple scenarios, also facilitated in this package, significantly reduce time invested in performing these tasks. Finally, efficient assessments of strict-extrapolation risks in model transfers via the MOP and MESS metrics help to prevent overinterpretation in model outcomes.\n","date":1549411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549411200,"objectID":"af542e8fdc5fd624397a3f498052d163","permalink":"https://marlonecobos..github.io/publication/10.7717-peerj.6281/","publishdate":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10.7717-peerj.6281/","section":"publication","summary":"A description of a set of tools for ecological niche modeling presented as an R package.","tags":["R programming","Open source","ENM"],"title":"kuenm: An R package for detailed development of ecological niche models using Maxent","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Many refinements have been made to the methodology over the years, and the result has been an approach that considers multiple sources of variation in geographic predictions, and how that variation translates into both specific predictions and uncertainty in those predictions. Although numerous previous reviews and overviews of this field have pointed out a series of assumptions and caveats associated with the methodology, three aspects of the methodology have important impacts but have not been treated previously in detail. Here, we assess those three aspects: (1) effects of niche truncation on model transfers to future climate conditions, (2) effects of model selection procedures on future-climate transfers of ecological niche models, and (3) relative contributions of several factors (replicate samples of point data, general circulation models, representative concentration pathways, and alternative model parameterizations) to overall variance in model outcomes. Overall, the view is one of caution: although resulting predictions are fascinating and attractive, this paradigm has pitfalls that may bias and limit confidence in niche model outputs as regards the implications of climate change for species’ geographic distributions.\n","date":1538352e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352e3,"objectID":"338bf75fba19c1694d4de78d855f3e63","permalink":"https://marlonecobos..github.io/publication/10.1111-nyas.13873/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10.1111-nyas.13873/","section":"publication","summary":"A reflection on the major obstacles for ecological niche modeling projections in future climate scenarios.","tags":["Biodiversity data","Data cleaning","Training manuals"],"title":"Major challenges for correlational ecological niche model projections to future climate conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlon E.

These changes are usually studied across broad areas, and understanding their effects on narrowly distributed endangered species is challenging. Peltophryne florentinoi is a critically endangered Cuban toad, restricted to two coastal localities and potentially threatened by these phenomena. Despite its endangered status, few analyses have focused on threats to its survival in the face of global change. Current and future threats from global change to this species were evaluated using ecological niche modelling and multiscale geographic information system (GIS) approaches. Climate change effects were assessed by comparing the species niche with six future (2050) climate scenarios across its distribution area. Risks from sealevel rise were evaluated by simulating potential coastal inundation under three scenarios of sea‐level rise. Recent land‐use changes were quantified using information on the loss of forest cover between 2000 and 2015. Within the species distribution area, warmer and drier conditions can be expected in the future. Sea‐level rise will not have direct impacts on the species range; however, occasional inundations and saltwater intrusion may present additional stressors. Although only ~2% of the forest cover has been lost in the species range and its surroundings during 2000–2015, deforestation trends were variable during this period, and future losses in forest cover can be expected. Considering these threats, and that the colonization of new areas seems unlikely, indirect and additive adverse effects on the species can be anticipated. These impacts will most probably be observed during the larval stage of this toad; hence, breeding sites constitute a key element in the conservation of this species. Longterm studies and experimental manipulations may be the next steps towards a better understanding of the responses of P. florentinoi to expected changes. Initial conservation actions are proposed based on these results and the ecology of this species.
