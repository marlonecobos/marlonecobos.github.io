### Research interests

My interests center around data integration and ecological modeling, with the overarching goal of comprehending ecological and biogeographic patterns, as well as the potential impacts of global change on biodiversity. My research focuses in three areas: (1) disease ecology and biogeography, and (2) methods and tool development for predictive modeling. I am deeply committed to promoting open science via open-source software development, and through active promotion of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science.
