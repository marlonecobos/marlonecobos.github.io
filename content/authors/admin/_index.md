### Research interests

My research interests include diverse questions in the area of ecological modeling. I focus on three main aspects: 1) methods and tool development for predictive modeling; 2) disease biogeography and risk mapping; and 3) integration of evolutionary adaptation in predictive modeling. I am committed to promoting open science, open source software development, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. To me, these values are essential for a thriving and successful scientific community and a better society.
