title: Tick talk at the KU Field Station
---

Hello, Kansas outdoor enthusiasts and curious minds! I'm thrilled to announce an upcoming science engagement activity that's sure to pique your interest. I will be talking about ticks in Kansas at the KU Field Station for one of their Science Sundays sessions on April 14, 2024.

Ticks are a part of life in Kansas, albeit a less welcome one, especially given their reputation as carriers of diseases to humans. If you have been outside in Kansas, chances are you've encountered ticks. While these tiny creatures play their role in the ecosystem, their potential to affect human health cannot be overlooked. Understanding the habits of ticks and the risks associated with them is the first step toward minimizing their impact on our health.

My presentation will cover what we have learned about the seasonal abundance of ticks in our state, their disease-carrying capabilities, and, how we can coexist safely with these little creatures. Our discussion will help us understand the peak times of tick activity, and define some measures to minimize the risks ticks pose.
