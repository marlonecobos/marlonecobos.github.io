Hantaviruses are RNA viruses associated with rodents and other mammals that cause human disease, with mortality rates of 12-60%. In the early 2000s, an outbreak of Choclo hantavirus in humans occurred on the Azuero Peninsula of Panama. Long-term surveys identified *Oligoryzomys coastaricensis*, the Costa Rican pygmy rice rat, and *Zygodontomys brevicauda*, the short-tailed cane mouse, as the primary reservoir hosts of hantaviruses in Panama (Choclo and Calabazo hantavirus strains, respectively). At ASM 2024, we are presenting the results of a project that used specimen and pathogen test-result data to model the ecological niches of these hantaviruses and their hosts, and explore suitability for these taxa at monthly bases (2000-2018).

## Suitability dynamics

Below you can find a GIF animation that shows dynamic suitability landscapes for *Oligoryzomys coastaricensis*. This animation shows monthly predictions of suitability 2000-2018.
