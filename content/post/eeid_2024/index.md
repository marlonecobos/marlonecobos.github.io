Tick-borne disease has come to be appreciated as a major public health concern in North America. *Amblyomma americanum*, the lone star tick, can transmit multiple zoonotic pathogens, including the primary causative agent of ehrlichiosis in humans. This tick species is also associated with the development of alpha-gal syndrome, or red meat allergy. This tick predominates in the eastern half of the United States (US) and has been moving westward over the last few decades.

## Predciting dynamics of questing activity

Tick questing activity refers to the behavior of ticks actively seeking a host to feed on. Our work focused on characterizing the environmental conditions that favor this behavior in ticks. Below you can find a GIF animation that shows the dynamics of suitability for questing for the lone star tick in the central great plains 20020-2022.
