## Who am I?

I am an early career scientist originally from Ecuador, now residing in the United States. My roots trace back to Zamora Chinchipe, a small province in the southernmost part of the country's Amazon region, but the majority of my life story unfolded in Loja, a picturesque city in the Andes.

My academic journey commenced at Universidad Nacional de Loja (Ecuador), and continue in Cuba at Universidad de La Habana for my master's degree. After that, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Kansas (USA). Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Biodiversity Institute at KU.

## What do I like?

### Research

Research occupies a central place in my life. My passion lies in delving into the mysteries of science, unraveling fresh research problems, and pursuing their solutions. My research interests span a diverse array of topics, all converging within the fascinating field of biogeography. My primary focus lies in discerning the factors governing geographic and environmental patterns of biodiversity.

### Sports

In my earlier years, sports held a significant place in my life. I dedicated numerous years to basketball and even participated in competitive leagues in Ecuador. However, in recent times, my engagement with sports has shifted towards recreational enjoyment, especially when shared with friends. Although I still enjoy shooting hoops, my leisure time is primarily devoted to volleyball and ping pong.

### Hobbies 

Beyond my scientific endeavors and sports, my leisure time is often occupied by my hobbies. Electronics and the art of tinkering hold a special appeal for me. There is an inexplicable satisfaction in assembling and fine-tuning intricate systems to perfection. Over the years, my interests in this domain have cultivated a fascination with tools, leading to the amassing of a comprehensive collection that some might consider excessive for my pursuits. Nevertheless, this toolset ensures that I am always well-prepared to tackle the next exciting project that comes my way.
