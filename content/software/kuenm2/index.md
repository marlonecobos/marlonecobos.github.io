## What is kuenm2?

**kuenm2** is a new major version of **kuenm**, and it is an R package that 
implements multiple tools to help with the development of detailed ecological 
niche models using distinct algorithms. Pre-modeling analyses and explorations 
can be done to prepare data. Model calibration (model selection) is done by 
training and testing several candidate models. Handy options for producing final
models with transfers are included. Other tools to assess extrapolation risks 
and variability in model transfers are also available.

## Check the kuenm package

If you want to try this tool you can install it on R from GitHub using 
`remotes::install_github("marlonecobos/kuenm2")`. We are currently preparing 
multiple detailed examples of how to use the package which will be available 
soon as vignettes. The package can be found in the GitHub repository
[kuenm2](https://github.com/marlonecobos/kuenm2).
