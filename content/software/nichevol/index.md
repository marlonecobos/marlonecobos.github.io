## What is nichevol?

**nichevol** is an R package that helps users to perform critical steps in the process of assessment of speciesâ€™ ecological niche evolution, with uncertainty incorporated explicitly in reconstructions. The method proposed here for ancestral reconstruction of ecological niches characterizes niches using a bin-based approach that incorporates uncertainty in estimations. Compared to other existing methods, the approaches presented here reduce risks of overestimation of amounts or rates of ecological niche evolution. The main analyses include: initial exploration of environmental data in occurrence records and accessible areas, preparation of data for phylogenetic analyses, comparative phylogenetic analyses, and plotting for interpretation. These tools are based on the methods proposed by [Owens et al. (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6359).
