## What is rangemap?

**rangemap** is an R package with various tools to create species range maps 
based on occurrence data, statistics, and SpatialPolygons objects. Other tools
of this package can be used to analyze environmental characteristics of the 
species ranges and to create high quality figures of these maps. All the 
functions that create species ranges can also generate representations of 
species extents of occurrence (using convex hulls) and areas of occupancy 
according to the IUCN criteria. Spatial files of the resulting polygons can 
be saved in the working directory if it is needed. These tools were presented 
by [Cobos et al. (2022)](https://journals.ku.edu/jbi/article/view/16271).

## Check the rangemap package

If you want to try this tool you can install it on R from GitHub using 
`remotes::install_github("marlonecobos/rangemap")`. The package and an example 
of its use can be found [here](https://github.com/marlonecobos/rangemap). 
However, many dependencies of the package are still being updated at the time.
