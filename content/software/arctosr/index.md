## What does ArctosR do?

**ArctosR** provides a set of functions to help users perform requests to the 
Arctos API to download data. It provides a set of  builder classes for performing 
complex requests, as well as a set of simple  functions for automating many 
common requests and workflows. More information about Arctos can be found in 
[Cicero et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296478).
