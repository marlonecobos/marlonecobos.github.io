## What is grinnell?

**grinnell** is an R package to simulate dispersal and accessibility based on 
niche estimations. One of the main functionalities is the simulation of species 
accessible areas (M), which can be used as calibration areas in Ecological 
Niche Models (ENM) and Species Distribution Models (SDM). These tools are based 
on the methods proposed by 
[Machado-Stredel et al. (2021)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8hq04438).
