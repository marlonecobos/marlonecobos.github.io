## What is ellipsenm?

**ellipsenm** is an R package that implements multiple tools to help in using ellipsoid envelopes to model ecological niches of species. Handy options for calibrating and selecting models, producing models with replicates and projections, and assessing niche overlap are included as part of this package. Other functions implemented here are useful to perform a series of pre- and post-modeling analyses. A good reference of it use in research is [Nuñez et al. (2021)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4f00x5r6).
