## What is mop?

**mop** is an R package with a set of tools to perform the Mobility 
Oriented-Parity (MOP) metric, which helps to compare a set of conditions of 
reference versus another set of of interest. The main goals of the MOP metric 
are to explore conditions in the set of interest that are non-analogous to 
those in the reference set, and to quantify how different conditions in the 
set of interest are. The tools included here help to identify conditions 
outside the rages of the reference set with greater detail than in earlier 
implementations. These tools are based on the methods presented in 
[Cobos et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.21425/fob.17.132916).

## Check the mop package

If you want to try this tool you can install it on R from CRAN using 
`install.packages("mop")` or from GitHub with 
`remotes::install_github("marlonecobos/mop")`. The package and an example of its
use can be found [here](https://github.com/marlonecobos/mop).
