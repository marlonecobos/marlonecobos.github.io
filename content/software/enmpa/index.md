## What is enmpa?

**enmpa** comprises a set of tools to perform Ecological Niche Modeling using 
presence-absence data and logistic generalized linear models. Some of the main 
functions help perform data partitioning, model calibration, model selection, 
variable response exploration, and model projection.
