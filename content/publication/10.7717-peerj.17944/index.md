### Abstract

Environmental dimensions, such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and 
vegetation type, influence the activity, survival, and geographic distribution 
of tick species. Ticks are vectors of various pathogens that cause disease in 
humans, and *Ixodes scapularis* and *Amblyomma americanum* are among the tick 
species that transmit pathogens to humans across the central and eastern 
United States. Although their potential geographic distributions have been 
assessed broadly via ecological niche modeling, no comprehensive study has 
compared ecological niche signals between ticks and tick-borne pathogens. We 
took advantage of National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data for these 
two tick species and associated bacteria pathogens across North America. We used 
two novel statistical tests that consider sampling and absence data explicitly 
to perform these explorations: a univariate analysis based on randomization and 
resampling, and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Based on 
univariate analyses, in *Amblyomma americanum*, three pathogens (*Borrelia lonestari*,
*Ehrlichia chaffeensis*, and *E. ewingii*) were tested; pathogens 
showed nonrandom distribution in at least one environmental dimension. Based 
on the PERMANOVA test, the null hypothesis that the environmental position and 
variation of pathogen-positive samples are equivalent to those of *A. americanum* 
could not be rejected for any of the pathogens, except for the pathogen 
*E. ewingii* in maximum and minimum vapor pressure and minimum temperature. 
For *Ixodes scapularis*, six pathogens (*A. phagocytophilum*, *Babesia microti*, 
*Borrelia burgdorferi* *sensu lato*, *B. mayonii*, *B. miyamotoi*, and 
*Ehrlichia muris*-like) were tested; only *B. miyamotoi* was not distinct from null 
expectations in all environmental dimensions, based on univariate tests. 
In the PERMANOVA analyses, the pathogens departed from null expectations for 
*B. microti* and *B. burgdorferi sensu lato*, with smaller niches in *B. microti*, and 
larger niches in B. burgdorferi sensu lato, than the vector. More generally,
this study shows the value of large-scale data resources with consistent 
sampling methods, and known absences of key pathogens in particular samples, 
for answering public health questions, such as the relationship of presence 
and absence of pathogens in their hosts respect to environmental conditions.
