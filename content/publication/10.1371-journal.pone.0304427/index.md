### Abstract

Ticks represent important vectors of a number of bacterial and viral disease 
agents, owing to their hematophagous nature and their questing behavior 
(the process in which they seek new hosts). Questing activity is notably 
seasonal with spatiotemporal dynamics that needs to be understood in detail as
part of mediating and mitigating tick-borne disease risk. Models of the 
geography of tick questing activity developed to date, however, have ignored 
the temporal dimensions of that behavior; more fundamentally, they have often 
not considered the sampling underlying available occurrence data. Here, we have 
addressed these shortfalls for *Amblyomma americanum*, the most commonly 
encountered tick in the central Great Plains, via (1) detailed, longitudinal 
sampling to characterize the spatiotemporal dimensions of tick questing activity; 
(2) randomization tests to establish in which environmental dimensions a species 
is manifesting selective use; and (3) modeling methods that include both 
presence data and absence data, taking fullest advantage of the information 
available in the data resource. The outcome was a detailed picture of geographic 
and temporal variation in suitability for the species through the two-year 
course of this study. Such models that take full advantage of available 
information will be crucial in understanding the risk of tick-borne disease 
into the future.
