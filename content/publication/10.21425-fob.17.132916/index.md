### Abstract

Multivariate model projections onto conditions that differ from those under 
which the models were calibrated can result in uncertainty owing to response 
extrapolation. Therefore, interpretations of models transferred to conditions 
not analogous to those of model calibration must be done carefully to avoid 
misleading conclusions. A good practice when producing model transfers is to 
assess the degree of dissimilarity between calibration and transfer conditions. 
The mobility oriented parity (MOP) metric is a tool commonly used to quantify 
such dissimilarities. Our study elucidated the details of MOP, and expanded the 
interpretability of results when transfer conditions are not analogous to those 
of model calibration. We implemented a more detailed characterization of 
non-analogous conditions previously only identified as outside calibration 
ranges. In addition, we quantified the sensitivity of MOP to the density and 
position of reference conditions in environmental space, and explored the effect
of sample size on MOP results. We show that detailed characterizations of 
non-analogous conditions can help to determine which variables are different 
between the two areas and how. This information can be used to understand 
causes of environmental dissimilarity and to identify variables that could be 
excluded from ecological niche modeling owing to extrapolation risks associated
with them. Our results also show that dissimilarity values calculated in 
comparisons offer good indicators of how reliable interpretations can be in 
areas with conditions not analogous to those of reference. The tools developed 
and implemented in this study provide a useful, quantitatively efficient means 
of characterizing extrapolation uncertainty in model transfer studies, a best 
practice when using multivariate ecological niche models to make predictions 
about species’ distributions.
