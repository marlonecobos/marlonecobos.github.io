### Abstract

The states of Kansas and Oklahoma, in the central Great Plains, lie at the western 
periphery of the geographic distributions of several tick species. As the focus 
of most research on ticks and tick-borne diseases has been on Lyme disease which 
commonly occurs in areas to the north and east, the ticks of this region have 
seen little research attention. Here, we report on the phenology and activity 
patterns shown by tick species observed at 10 sites across the two states and 
explore factors associated with abundance of all and life specific individuals 
of the dominant species. Ticks were collected in 2020–2022 using dragging, 
flagging and carbon-dioxide trapping techniques, designed to detect questing 
ticks. The dominant species was *A. americanum* (24098, 97%) followed by 
*Dermacentor variabilis* (370, 2%), *D. albipictus* (271, 1%), *Ixodes scapularis* 
(91, <1%) and A. maculatum (38, <1%). Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum and 
*D. variabilis* were active in Spring and Summer, while *D. albipictus* and
*I. scapularis* were active in Fall and Winter. Factors associated with numbers 
of individuals of *A. americanum* included day of year, habitat, and latitude. 
Similar associations were observed when abundance was examined by life-stage. 
Overall, the picture is one of broadly distributed tick species that shows 
seasonal limitations in the timing of their questing activity.
