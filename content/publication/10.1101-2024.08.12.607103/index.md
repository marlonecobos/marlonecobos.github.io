### Abstract

Surveillance and monitoring of zoonotic pathogens is key to identifying and 
mitigating emerging public health threats. Surveillance is often designed to 
be taxonomically targeted or systematically dispersed across geography, however,
those approaches may not represent the breadth of environments inhabited by a 
host, vector, or pathogen, leaving significant gaps in our understanding of 
pathogen dynamics in their natural reservoirs and environments. As a case study 
on the design of pathogen surveillance programs, we assess how well 20 years of 
small mammal surveys in Panamá have sampled available environments and propose a
multistep approach to selecting survey localities in the future. We use >8,000 
georeferenced mammal specimen records, collected as part of a long-term 
hantavirus surveillance program, to test the completeness of country-wide 
environmental sampling. Despite 20 years of surveillance, our analyses 
identified a few key environmental sampling gaps. To refine surveillance
strategies, we selected a series of core historically sampled localities, 
supplemented with additional environmentally distinct sites to more completely 
represent Panama’s environments. Based on lessons learned through decades of 
surveillance, we propose a series of recommendations to improve strategic 
sampling for zoonotic pathogen surveillance.
