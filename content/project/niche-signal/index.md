Exploring and analyzing biodiversity data is something that I have always wanted 
to do. I am part of a group of researchers in charge of the development of a few
informatics tools aiming to help researchers to understand biodiversity patterns.

### Biodiversity inventory

Have you ever wondered where to go to register biodiversity more efficiently?

**[biosurvey](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biosurvey)** is an R package 
that implements multiple tools to select sampling sites for biodiversity 
inventory. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of such sites
by considering the relationship between environmental and geographic conditions 
in a region of interest. Take a look at the [code](https://github.com/claununez/biosurvey/)
and [user guide](https://claununez.github.io/biosurvey/) if you are interested.

### Simple ways to explore species ranges

If you want to perform quick and simple explorations of species distribution 
ranges based on occurrence data, this may interest you.

**[rangemap](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rangemap)** is an R package 
with tools to create species range maps based on occurrence data, statistics, 
and Spatial objects. Other tools of this package can be used to analyze 
environmental characteristics of the species ranges and to create high quality 
figures of these maps. Take a look at the [code](https://github.com/marlonecobos/rangemap)
and [user guide](https://marlonecobos.github.io/rangemap/) if you are interested.
