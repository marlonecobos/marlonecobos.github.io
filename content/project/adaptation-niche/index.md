This is an ongoing project that uses a duckweed species (*Spirodela polyrhiza*) as a model organism. With its small genome size and comprehensive ecological and physiological information, this duckweed is an ideal model to study this type of question. Ultimately, my aims to shedding light on the interplay between evolution, environmental resilience, and genomic dynamics in predictive modeling.

We have collected individuals of this species across the state of Kansas, and obtained individuals from around the world. We are currently growing colonies from these individuals, and performing initial experiments under controlled conditions.
