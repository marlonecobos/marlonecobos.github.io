Most of my current work is focused on understanding host-pathogen interaction
dynamics across space and time. Our study focuses on Hantavirus and its host in
Panama. Thanks to the availability of data deriving from >20 years of local and 
collaborative surveillance we are able to explore this interesting phenomenon 
for the entire country and at monthly basis.

We explore the dynamics of this interaction via metapopulation models that 
integrate time-specific ecological niche modeling, epidemiological models, 
and dispersal simulations that interact in cellular automaton. Check out a 
simple view of our initial results below.

### Next steps

- Represent and account for variability and uncertainty in predictions.
- Test additional options in which suitability modulates parameters.
- Assess sensitivity of metapopulation models to a range of parameters in the 
epidemiological model and dispersal simulation.
