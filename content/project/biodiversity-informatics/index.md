I have been interested in informatics tools to deal with ecological modeling 
and simulations since I started my PhD. Bellow you can find a brief description
of the tools I have developed with the help of an amazing group of colleagues.

### Ecological niche modeling

The following is a list of tools that implement methods and techniques to 
perform a series of steps in order to characterize and project ecological niches 
of species. These characterizations allow us to
hypothesize about the factors that drive species distributions, and where 
suitable conditions exist.

### Dispersal simulations

The following is a list of tools that implement methods and techniques to 
perform a series of steps in order to characterize and project ecological niches 
of species. These characterizations allow us to
hypothesize about the factors that drive species distributions, and where 
suitable conditions exist.
