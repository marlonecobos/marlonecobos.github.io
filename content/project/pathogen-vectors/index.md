Part of my current research centers on integration of data to account for environmental conditions at particular times to create much-improved, time-specific models that capture distributional or demographic dynamics through time. These ideas are applicable to diverse ecological phenomena, and results are promising.

We have developed software to facilitate the implementation of these ideas, and explored the validity of these methods with multiple examples. Some of our current applications are being developed for tick activity and prevalence of tick-pathogens in the Great Plains. Other applications are aimed to produce characterizations of seasonal host-pathogen dynamics in Panama.

### Next steps

- Characterize variability and uncertainty in predictions
- Integrate results in simulations of host-pathogen population dynamics
